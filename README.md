## üìù About the Project

This contract was developed as part of a partnership between **3D Studio Europe** and **Shinobi** to provide a robust staking solution on the Shido Blockchain. This staking contract allows Shinobi's community to participate in staking activities, where they can earn rewards and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Pool Staking**: Supports multiple staking pools, each with unique reward tokens and APY (Annual Percentage Yield).
- **Secure Staking Mechanism**: Includes cooldown periods, reentrancy protections, and a structured fee mechanism.
- **Configurable Reward System**: Enables flexible reward distribution based on APY and Total Value Locked (TVL) in each pool.
- **Compatibility with Shido Blockchain**: Tailored to work seamlessly on the Shido Blockchain, which is EVM-compatible.
